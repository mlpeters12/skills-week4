-- Note: Please consult the directions for this assignment 
-- for the most explanatory version of each question.

-- 1. Select all columns for all brands in the Brands table.
SELECT * FROM brands;

-- 2. Select all columns for all car models made by Pontiac in the Models table.
SELECT * FROM models WHERE brand_name = 'Pontiac';

-- 3. Select the brand name and model 
--    name for all models made in 1964 from the Models table.
SELECT brand_name, name FROM models WHERE year = '1964';

-- 4. Select the model name, brand name, and headquarters for the Ford Mustang 
--    from the Models and Brands tables.
SELECT models.name, models.brand_name, brands.headquarters 
FROM models 
JOIN brands USING (id);
-- 5. Select all rows for the three oldest brands 
--    from the Brands table (Hint: you can use LIMIT and ORDER BY).
SELECT * FROM brands ORDER BY founded DESC LIMIT 3;

-- 6. Count the Ford models in the database (output should be a number).
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM models WHERE brand_name = 'Ford';

-- 7. Select the name of any and all car brands that are not discontinued.
SELECT name FROM brands WHERE discontinued IS NULL;

-- 8. Select rows 15-25 of the DB in alphabetical order by model name.
SELECT * FROM models LIMIT 11 OFFSET 14;
--  *Wasn't sure if you wanted it ordered by id, so if that were the case
--  *I would do: SELECT * FROM models ORDER BY id LIMIT 11 OFFSET 14;


-- 9. Select the brand, name, and year the model's brand was 
--    founded for all of the models from 1960. Include row(s)
--    for model(s) even if its brand is not in the Brands table.
--    (The year the brand was founded should be NULL if 
--    the brand is not in the Brands table.)
SELECT models.brand_name, models.name, brands.founded 
FROM models
LEFT JOIN brands USING (id)
WHERE year = 1960;

-- Part 2: Change the following queries according to the specifications. 
-- Include the answers to the follow up questions in a comment below your
-- query.

-- 1. Modify this query so it shows all brands that are not discontinued
-- regardless of whether they have any models in the models table.
-- before:
    SELECT b.name,
           b.founded,
           m.name
    FROM brands AS b
      LEFT JOIN models AS m
        ON b.name = m.brand_name
    WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;

-- 2. Modify this left join so it only selects models that have brands in the Brands table.
-- before: 
    SELECT m.name,
           m.brand_name,
           b.founded
    FROM models AS m
      INNER JOIN brands AS b
        ON b.name = m.brand_name;

-- followup question: In your own words, describe the difference between 
-- left joins and inner joins.
--  *Inner Joins only look at the the information that overlaps between tables (matching data),
--  *Left Joins provide all info from the main table and any matching data from the secondary table

-- 3. Modify the query so that it only selects brands that don't have any models in the models table. 
-- (Hint: it should only show Tesla's row.)
-- before: 
    SELECT b.name,
           b.founded
    FROM brands as b  
      LEFT JOIN models as m
        ON b.name = m.brand_name
    WHERE m.year > 1940 
    and b.name NOT IN (
        SELECT b.name FROM brands as b 
            INNER JOIN models as m
                ON b.name = m.brand_name
        GROUP BY b.name);
--  *BOOOOOOM!

-- 4. Modify the query to add another column to the results to show 
-- the number of years from the year of the model until the brand becomes discontinued
-- Display this column with the name years_until_brand_discontinued.
-- before: 
    SELECT b.name,
           m.name,
           m.year,
           b.discontinued,
           (SUM(discontinued) - SUM(year)) AS years_until_brand_discontinued
    FROM Models AS m
      LEFT JOIN brands AS b
        ON m.brand_name = b.name
    WHERE b.discontinued IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY b.name, m.name, m.year, b.discontinued;




-- Part 3: Further Study

-- 1. Select the name of any brand with more than 5 models in the database.
SELECT b.name FROM brands as b 
LEFT JOIN models AS m ON b.name = m.brand_name
GROUP BY b.name HAVING COUNT(m.name) >5;

-- 2. Add the following rows to the Models table.

-- year    name       brand_name
-- ----    ----       ----------
-- 2015    Chevrolet  Malibu
-- 2015    Subaru     Outback

--  *YEP!
-- INSERT INTO models (year, name, brand_name)
-- VALUES (2015, 'Chevrolet','Malibu');
-- INSERT 0 1
-- INSERT INTO models (year, name, brand_name)                                         VALUES (2015, 'Subaru','Outback');
-- INSERT 0 1

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to crate a table called `Awards`
--    with columns `name`, `year`, and `winner`. Choose
--    an appropriate datatype and nullability for each column
--   (no need to do subqueries here).

-- 4. Write a SQL statement that adds the following rows to the Awards table:

--   name                 year      winner_model_id
--   ----                 ----      ---------------
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      the id for the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      the id for the 2015 Subaru Outback

-- 5. Using a subquery, select only the *name* of any model whose 
-- year is the same year that *any* brand was founded.
SELECT m.name FROM models as m 
FULL OUTER JOIN brands AS b ON m.brand_name = b.name 
WHERE m.year IN (SELECT founded FROM brands);
